# 📘 Daily Study: *The Linux Programming Interface* by Michael Kerrisk

Welcome! This repository documents my daily learning journey through *The Linux Programming Interface (TLPI)* — a comprehensive and authoritative guide to system programming on Linux and UNIX systems.

## 📖 About the Book

*The Linux Programming Interface* by Michael Kerrisk is widely regarded as one of the most essential references for programmers working with Linux and UNIX systems. Spanning over 1,500 pages, the book delves deep into the Linux kernel API, glibc, and low-level system programming using the C programming language.

Kerrisk, the former maintainer of the Linux man-pages project, provides clear explanations, code examples, and best practices for writing robust and efficient system-level applications.

## 🎯 Why This Book Matters

Understanding system programming is critical for developers who want to:

- Build efficient and secure applications that interact closely with the OS.
- Understand how operating systems work under the hood.
- Write software like shells, file utilities, daemons, or even parts of the OS.
- Interface directly with process control, memory management, file I/O, and more.

This book equips readers with the skills to write C programs that interact directly with the Linux kernel and the underlying hardware.

## 🧠 What is System Programming?

System programming involves writing code that interacts directly with the operating system's API and manages hardware and resources. It includes topics such as:

- File descriptors and file I/O
- Memory management (e.g., `mmap`, `malloc`, `brk`)
- Process creation (`fork`, `exec`) and signaling
- Multithreading and synchronization
- IPC (Inter-process Communication)
- Network programming using sockets
- The `/proc` filesystem and kernel interfaces

In the Linux environment, system programming is most commonly done in **C**, as it allows fine-grained control over memory and system calls — the foundation of efficient and low-level OS interaction.
